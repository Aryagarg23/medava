### Static vs. Non-Static Methods
I understand the concept of static methods being associated with a class rather than an object instance. However, I'm still a bit unclear about the specific use cases where static methods are more appropriate than non-static methods. Could you provide more examples to illustrate the difference?

### Inheritance and Polymorphism
In our simulation, we've used inheritance to create a `Medicine` superclass and potential subclasses. How can we leverage polymorphism to dynamically determine the behavior of different medicine types at runtime? For instance, could we have a method that calculates the shipping cost based on the medicine type, and have it automatically select the correct implementation based on the object's actual type?

### Exception Handling
How can we incorporate exception handling into our simulation to handle potential errors, such as a transporter exceeding its capacity or a medicine being incompatible with the transportation conditions? What are some best practices for designing robust exception handling mechanisms?

### Concurrency and Threading
If we wanted to simulate multiple transporters or pharmacies operating concurrently, how would we approach this using Java's concurrency and threading mechanisms? What are the potential challenges and strategies for ensuring thread safety and avoiding race conditions?

### Design Patterns
Are there any specific design patterns that could be applied to our supply chain simulation to improve its modularity, reusability, and maintainability? For example, could we use the Factory Pattern to create different types of transporters or the Observer Pattern to notify interested parties of changes in the supply chain?

### Java Memory Management
How does Java's garbage collection mechanism work? Can we manually control the memory allocation and deallocation processes in our simulation, or should we rely on the JVM's automatic garbage collection?

### OOP Principles in Practice
While we've used inheritance and encapsulation in our simulation, how can we further apply the principles of abstraction and polymorphism to make our code more flexible and adaptable to future changes?

### Testing and Debugging
What are effective strategies for testing and debugging Java applications, especially when dealing with complex simulations? Are there any specific tools or techniques that can help identify and fix issues?
